<!-- a quick note: a.m. stands for ante meridiem, and p.m. stands for post meridiem. Meridiem is latin for mid-day (noon) Hope that helps to put that last image into context -->

Instructions/Rules:
This is an open internet test. You can use anything out there as examples. But if you use techniques not used in this class I will know and depending on how you apply them you may not get the score you are looking for. Start with class examples that are similar. Try taking the tasks you need for the clock/countdown to work step by step. Write your steps out in simple english and then try to write your code straightforwardly -- the fewer lines of code you use the better.

Remember working with the date object is straight JS. The W3Schools has great stuff on the date object and tons of references. You can see tons of examples for how to work with the date object. We also wrote a JS clock that you can use a good portion (but not all of) to start off your code (look in the GitHub repository -- you should find the day we did a clock and the countdown in class). You can reference the class schedule as well. It shoud tell you the day(s) we worked with the date object. 

Rules: Do not alter the HTML above. You can do what I have asked with what's already there. 

Hint 1: Break the problem down. What is it you need to do? Make the images display the right time. How do I go about changing the images shown?

Hint 2: Find the right selectors, possibly change any attributes with JS that are necessary to alter the images and use the methods we've learned in class for how and when to change the numbers.

Hint 3: Important to note is what data type is your current thing - strings, numbers, arrays? Methods that work on type, don't always work on another type.

Hint 4: Make sure that you have the display part working, then figure out how to make it run more than once. We've seen a number of ways to do that. 

More hints: Make sure you strip out any unnecessary code. (commenting out code that you tried but does not work does not count against you). You do not want variable values to generate if you don't need them. You can comment out and comment lines will not count against the length of your code. Make comments liberally, so I can see any attempts you made that didn't work.

Also feel free to make comments in your code for something you were trying to get to work and maybe did not accomplish. I can at least then see if you were at least looking in the right direction and potentially give you partial credit for that.


How to post your completed test:

When you are done, zip the files and submit though google classroom by the set due date.

This is not my usual softish deadline! *Ahem* If it is late you will have points off because I will be discussing the solution first thing the morning it is doe. And it will be too late if it is turned in after I have discussed the solution. You will get no points then. So get it turned in on time!

Your uploaded zip file should have your first name, last initial and the word final. So for example my zip file would be: trishl-final.zip. This is so that when I download your files and save them to look at them, your file and anyone else’s is not in danger of overwriting another person’s (or your) file. Thank you for following this important protocol. If I have to rename your file to meet this specification — you will have points removed from your end score.

You totally got this; I have faith in you.
