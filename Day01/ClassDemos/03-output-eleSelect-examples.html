//onresize is an event listener that listens for when the window is resized (make the browser window bigger/smaller)
//this is an anonymous function as it has no name. The event listener is what calls it to run.

		console.log('height:', winHeight); //example of passing multiple arguments to console.log()

		//example of interpolation which also allows for strings that take up multilines. concatenation does not allow for multiline.

		//even though there is only one element in this node list, it still must be accessed with [] notation. querySelectorAll expects a number of items to be selected, even if there is only one or even none.
